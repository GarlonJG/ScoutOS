I hope you're doing well! I recently applied for the Software Development Engineer in Test position on 5/31. I wanted to follow up on the status of that application and share how genuinely excited I am about the opportunity to contribute to IOHK’s mission to contribute to the decentralizing identity and finance on a global level.
I bring over a decade of experience in software development, test automation, and CI/CD infrastructure—with a particular focus on building reliable, developer-friendly systems. I’ve worked across the stack using tools like React, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Playwright, Cypress, GitHub Actions, Docker, and more. As noted in my cover letter, I’m currently developing ScoutOS, a personal AI assistant project, which has deepened my hands-on experience with AI/ML concepts and modern dev tooling.
Beyond technical skills, I’m a fast learner and strong decipherer—whether diving into unfamiliar codebases or tracking down elusive bugs. I have a natural “big-picture” mindset, a deep passion for automation, and I’m entirely self-taught, which reflects my constant drive to grow and evolve.
What you'll get with me is someone who:
	•	Thinks in systems, not silos – I naturally look for ways to improve pipelines, developer experience, and product quality holistically
	•	Thrives in collaborative environments – I enjoy partnering closely with product, QA, and platform teams
	•	Delivers thoughtful, clean solutions – I aim to balance speed, scale, and stability
While I initially applied that role, I also want to express interest in the following positions, where I believe I could bring immediate value:
	•	Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) - Midnight
	•	Front End Developer - WebGL
Thanks again for your time and consideration—I’d love the opportunity to connect and explore how I could support Vanta’s engineering efforts.
